Data Integrity algorithms for RDF Datasets â€” Proof of concepts implementation

This is a proof-of-concept implementation (in Typescript) of the [Verifiable Credentials Data Integrity (DI)](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-integrity/) specification of the W3C. The DI specification is primarily aimed at [Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/) (i.e., JSON-LD based data structures to express credentials) but the approach is such that it can be used for any kind of RDF Datasets. This implementation does that.

It is proof-of-concepts, because, primarily at validation time it lacks the rigorous checking of the proofs to be validating that is necessary for a security related tool. What it proves, however, that the DI specification may indeed be used to provide a proof for an RDF Dataset in the form of a separate "Proof Graph", i.e., an RDF Graph containing a signature that can be separated by a verifier.

The steps for signature follow the "usual" approach for signing data, namely:

1. The input RDF Dataset is canonicalized, using the [RDF Dataset Canonicalization](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-canon/), as defined by the W3C.
2. The resulting canonical N-Quads are sorted, and hashed to yield a canonical hash of the Dataset (the W3C specification relies on SHA-256 for hashing).
3. The hash is signed using a secret key for ECDSA. The signature value is stored as a bas64url following the [Multibase](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-multiformats-multibase) format.
4. A separate "proof graph" is generated, that includes the signature value, some basic metadata, and the public key of for the signature, stored in [JWK format](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7517).

The package has separate API entries to generate, and validate, such proof graphs. It is also possible, following the DI spec, to provide "embedded" proofs, i.e., a new dataset, containing the original data, as well as the proof graph(s), each as a separate graph within the dataset. If a separate "anchor" resource is provided, then this new dataset will also contain additional RDF triples connecting the anchor to the proof graphs.
